## User Stories:
1) **Young Jewish**, is a Jewish/American rapper who has recently dropped out of relevancy within the rap game. He spent most of his scratch on jewelry, strippers, and substance. Poor guy didn't think to invest, and now his family is disappointed in his poor money management. His grandmother is the only one to offer help. She's a mean cook, and knows a guy who will buy her grandson's cuban links. They gather the money to start up a small restaurant in downtown Memphis, and all their friends frequent the location. Soon they realize that they need to expand their market, and advertise to the local populace. Young Jewish, or Asher as his birth-name goes, remembers how his PR agent had emphasized internet presence and the importance of creating a brand. He discovers Web Chef, and instantly digs their style. He chooses them because of their fresh templates, and the ease of customization achieved through their administrator panel. He is also psyched to use the customer interaction interface to connect with his fans *ahem*, customers.

2) **Samantha**, has a bakery. She's locally famous for being super creative with her creations, and the events that she hosts. A friend suggested that she promote herself online, showing her how easy it was with Web Chef. After checking it out, Sam fell in love with the design templates that Web Chef offered. She especially adored their interface for blogging her event and community updates.
